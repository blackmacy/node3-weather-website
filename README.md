# Weather Application

This weather API is a simple full stack project, that allows you to get the current weather by simply typing in a location you want to search for.
It uses data from mapbox.com to get the location (specifically longtitude and latitude) typed in by the user. 
It then uses data from weatherstack.com to get the current weather information of the location.
The API is deployed using Heroku.
